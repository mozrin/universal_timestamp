## About

The Moztopia Universal Timestamp Library is a small, deterministic, zero‑dependency C implementation of the Universal Timestamp Specification (UTS).  
Its purpose is simple: provide a stable, cross‑platform timestamp format and API that behaves identically across all languages, all environments, and all time sources.

This library is designed for systems where correctness, reproducibility, and clarity matter more than convenience.  
No timezones. No locale quirks. No surprises.

If you need timestamps you can trust — this is the foundation.

Check out our other implementations for PHP, Python, Dart, Javascript, C++, Rust, and more.

We are always looking for help to maintain this project. If you are interested in contributing, please check out our [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

## Specification

The full Universal Timestamp Specification (UTS) defines:

- Canonical and extended timestamp formats  
- Strict and lenient parsing rules  
- Nanosecond precision  
- Monotonic timestamp guarantees  
- Cross‑language conformance requirements  
- Zero‑dependency constraints  
- Reference test vectors

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — especially ports to other languages, conformance tests, and improvements to the reference C implementation.

Before contributing, please review:

- Coding style expectations  
- Conformance requirements  
- Test vector rules
