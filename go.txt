You are going to look at the specification and write this code. Note .. 

the universal_timestamp.c is the core file.

all public functions/method should me created separately in the same directory.
all private functions/method should me created separately in the core/ directory.

Basically .. if we are going to expose a function to the user, we should create 
a separate file for it in the src/ directory. If it is a private function, we
should create a separate file in the core/ directory.

write the code ... provide docblocks that are useful for the user and linting
software for all public functions. For private functions provide a basic 
description of the methid/function. Never put any other comments in the code.

Always put a blank line after the end of a comment block.
